House Price Prediction using Forward Selection
## Step 1: Evaluate Each Feature Alone
R^2 with Area:      0.5917
R^2 with Rooms:     0.8791
R^2 with Distance:  0.5243
R^2 with Age:       0.0261

 Best single feature is 'Area'.

## Step 2: Add a Second Feature to 'Area'
R^2 with Area + Rooms:    0.9837
R^2 with Area + Distance: 0.9898
R^2 with Area + Age:      0.6986

 Best two-feature combination is 'Area' and 'Rooms'.

## Step 3: Stopping and Final Model Summary
Forward selection results:

Step                    Features Included Model R^2
   1                             ['Area']    0.5917
   2                    ['Area', 'Rooms']    0.9837
   3        ['Area', 'Rooms', 'Distance']    0.9999
   4 ['Area', 'Rooms', 'Distance', 'Age']    1.0000

Since the R^2 score increases significantly with each added feature,
the model with all four features is the best choice for this dataset.
